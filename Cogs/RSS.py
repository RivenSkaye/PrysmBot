""" RSS Reading cog for sending RSS feed information to Webhooks.

This was built with the intent of sending stuff to Discord servers,
leveraging the Webhook system to circumvent auth requirements, whilst
allowing for users to separate the information per source visually and
using names and identifiers of their choice.
Webhooks given are parsed and checked to be actual Discord links and
present in the server they're added from.

                The original code was theirs, rewritten to be callable from a
                Discord bot. It has since been rewritten again, but maintains
                their core parsing code with a small added check on the id/guid
